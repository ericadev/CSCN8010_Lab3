## Setting up
In order to run this project, set up a Python environment and ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` as usual. You will also need to use DVC in order to obtain the images, as at https://dvc.org/  I have uploaded the images to an S3 bucket, URL available upon request.

## Dataset
This project uses part of a Kaggle dataset on dogs vs cats, and can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats Only the first 5,000 images have been used in this project, but the code is there to extract it from the whole dataset if needed.
